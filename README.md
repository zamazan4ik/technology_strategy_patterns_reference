Technology Strategy Patterns Reference

## What is it?
This is a short compilation from the "Technology Strategy Patterns" book (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/technology-strategy-patterns/9781492040866/).

## Current status
Work in progress. Not sure, will I finish it or not, since the original book also could be used as a reference.

## Why AsciiDoc?
Markdown is too simple for the task, Latex is too complex for the task. I think AsciiDoc is good enough for this task.

## Contributing
If you found an error or have a good addition - feel free to create an issue or open a PR.

## Contacts
If you are Eben Hewitt (the original book author) or know how to contact him - please let me know! I will be happy to make this compilation a little more official.
