=== RACI

RACI - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.

- Responsible
These people do the hands-on work to complete this task. Depending on the nature of the items in your work list, this can be any level of title.
- Accountable
These people are answerable to executives for this item being delivered on time with appropriate fitness and quality. May be a VP or director.
- Consulted
These are subject-matter experts on some aspect of the system. They are not directly on the hook for doing the work. They may make local decisions or certain aspects that you seek them out for. They’ll give advice such that their ideas will change your work, the design, or otherwise modify your strategy. Identifying the right Cs on a project is the difference between a lot of buy-in and a robust product, and something more tepid. If you’re mak‐ ing new software, you should likely consult the CISO’s office.
- Informed
This is a one-way street. You update these people on project sta‐ tus, and they don’t have a say or a recommendation about the work you’re doing and can’t change it. This category might include the VP of tax so that he’s aware of your project and can look you up when it’s time to determine if he can apply for an R&D tax credit.
