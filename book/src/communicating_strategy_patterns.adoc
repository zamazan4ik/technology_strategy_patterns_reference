Here’s how you do it:

class, we all called this the “topic sentence”—it’s the claim you’re making. Make sure the headlines have rhetorical punch.
3. Once you’ve written all the headlines, review them, making sure they are impactful, make a bold claim, and build together, as we learned in “Dramatic Structure” on page 179 and “Ars Rhetor‐ ica” on page 167.
4. Now you can assign someone to go get the research and write up the actual content in stages, make the charts and graphs, and write up the bullet points that prove the headline.
5. Have that helper send you the work in stages for frequent shoul‐ der checks and revisions (or maybe it’s you playing both roles, and that’s fine too).
